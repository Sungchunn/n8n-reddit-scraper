# Reddit Scraper Demo (n8n Workflow)

This repository contains an n8n workflow that scrapes posts from the `r/n8n` subreddit based on selected keywords like `n8n`, `workflow examples`, and `best practices`. It filters posts with at least 10 upvotes and uses OpenAI to classify whether they are useful for learning n8n real-world use cases. Approved posts are then sent to a Discord channel via webhook.
